Description: OSS Proxy Daemon: Userland OSS emulation
 OSS Proxy Daemon is a Linux userland OSS sound device (/dev/[a]dsp and
 /dev/mixer) implementation using CUSE. Currently it supports
 forwarding OSS sound streams to PulseAudio and ALSA.
 .
 Actually emulating the OSS devices makes for a more robust emulation compared
 to OSS wrappers using LD_PRELOAD, like aoss and padsp. It also works better
 when running foreign-architecture applications or using old libc versions for
 compatibility reasons.
